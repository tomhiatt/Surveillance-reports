abstract = {The replication of important findings by multiple independent investigators is fundamental to the accumulation of scientific evidence. Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.},

@article{Wang2007,
abstract = {China has the world's second largest tuberculosis epidemic, but progress in tuberculosis control was slow during the 1990s. Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30\% of the estimated total of new cases, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was a major problem. These signs of inadequate tuberculosis control can be linked to a malfunctioning health system. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public-health system. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its commitment and leadership to tackle public-health problems and, among other efforts, increased public-health funding, revised laws that concerned the control of infectious diseases, implemented the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system, and started a programme to rebuild local public-health facilities. These measures contributed to acceleration in efforts to control tuberculosis. By 2005, the detection of cases of tuberculosis had increased to 80\% of the estimated total new cases, permitting China to achieve the 2005 global tuberculosis control targets. At the same time, specific efforts to improve tuberculosis control also contributed to strengthening of the public-health system. We examine how the strengthening of a disease control programme and the public-health system worked together to achieve a desired health outcome. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@techreport{,
abstract = {The World Health Organization's Stop TB Department has prepared this fourth edition of Treatment of Tuberculosis: Guidelines, adhering fully to the new WHO process for evidence-based guidelines. Several important recommendations are being promoted in this new edition.First, the recommendation to discontinue the regimen based on just 2 months of rifampicin (2HRZE/6HE) and change to the regimen based on a full 6 months of rifampicin (2HRZE/4HR) will reduce the number of relapses and failures. This will alleviate patient suffering resulting from a second episode of tuberculosis (TB) and conserve patient and programme resources.Second, this fourth edition confirms prior WHO recommendations for drug susceptibility testing (DST) at the start of therapy for all previously treated patients. Finding and treating multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in previously treated patients will help to improve the very poor outcomes in these patients. New recommendations for the prompt detection and appropriate treatment of (MDR-TB) cases will also improve access to life-saving care.Third, detecting MDR-TB will require expansion of DST capacity within the context of country-specific, comprehensive plans for laboratory strengthening. This fourth edition provides guidance for treatment approaches in the light of advances in laboratory technology and the country's progress in building laboratory capacity.Fourth, diagnosing MDR-TB cases among previously treated patients and providing effective treatment will greatly help in halting the spread of MDR-TB. This edition also addresses the prevention of acquired MDR-TB, especially among new TB patients who already have isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis when they start treatment.Finally, this edition strongly reaffirms prior recommendations for supervised treatment, as well as the use of fixed-dose combinations of anti-TB drugs and patient kits as further measures for preventing the acquisition of drug resistance.},

@techreport{WorldHealthOrganization2011,
abstract = {Significant progress has been made in TB control in the Western Pacific Region in the past decade with a decline in the number of prevalent TB patients and the diagnosis treatment of over 10 million patients. Despite these successes, TB control programmes in the Region face significant challenges, such as hard-to-reach vulnerable and marginalized groups, in which the TB epidemic tends to concentrate, TB-HIV co-infection and the emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB, especially multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). To mitigate these threats, the Regional Strategy to Stop Tuberculosis in the Western Pacific (2011-2015) was developed in consultation with and endorsed by Member States. The new Strategy builds upon the previous two regional strategic plans and introduces new, evidence-based interventions and technologies in response to the new and emerging challenges. The Strategy provides a reference for action to be taken, focusing on five core objectives: (1) Promoting universal and equitable access to quality TB diagnosis and treatment for all people; (2) Strengthening TB laboratory capacity; (3) Scaling up the programmatic management of drug-resistant TB; (4) Expanding TB/HIV collaborative activities; and (5) Strengthening TB programme management capacity.},

abstract = {This is the nineteenth global report on tuberculosis (TB) published by WHO in a series that started in 1997. It provides a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the TB epidemic and progress in implementing and financing TB prevention, care and control at global, regional and country levels using data reported by over 200 countries that account for over 99\% of the world's TB cases. The report is accompanied by a special supplement that marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Global Project on Anti-TB Drug Resistance Surveillance. The supplement highlights the latest status of knowledge about the epidemic of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and the programmatic response. The report has 9 main chapters. The introductory chapter provides general background on TB as well as an explanation of current global targets for TB control, the WHO's Stop TB Strategy that covers the period 2006-2015 and the post-2015 global TB strategy that was recently endorsed by all Member States at the 2014 World Health Assembly. The remaining eight chapters cover the disease burden caused by TB (incidence, prevalence, mortality); a special assessment ("countdown to 2015) of progress towards 2015 global TB targets at global, regional and country level; TB case notifications and treatment outcomes; drug resistance surveillance among TB patients and the programmatic response in detecting and providing treatment for multidrug-resistant TB; diagnostics and laboratory strengthening for TB; addressing the co-epidemics of TB and HIV; financing TB care and control; and research and development for new TB diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. The three annexes of the report include an explanation of how to access and use the online global TB database, one-page profiles for 22 high TB-burden countries and one page regional profiles for WHO's six regions.},
