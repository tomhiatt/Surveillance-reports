abstract = {BACKGROUND: A consistent finding of representative surveys that were conducted in Germany in the early 1990s was that people with depression encountered a substantial amount of stigma and discrimination. The aim of this study was to examine whether public attitudes have improved over the last decade or not. METHODS: In 2001, a representative survey was carried out among the adult population of the "old" Federal Republic of Germany using the same methodology as in a previous survey in 1990. RESULTS: Regarding emotional reactions of the respondents towards people with depression, our findings are inconsistent. While there has been an increase in the readiness to feel pity and also a slight increase in the tendency to react aggressively, the expression of fear remained unchanged. The public's desire for social distance from people with depression was as strong in 2001 as it had been in 1990. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis of a change for the better regarding public attitudes towards depressed people is not supported by our findings. Further efforts are needed to reach this goal.},

abstract = {Blackwell Publishing is delighted to announce that this book has been Highly Commended in the 2004 BMA Medical Book Competition. Here is the judges summary of this book: This is a technical book on a technical subject but presented in a delightful way. There are many books on statistics for doctors but there are few that are excellent and this is certainly one of them. Statistics is not an easy subject to teach or write about. The authors have succeeded in producing a book that is as good as it can get. For the keen student who does not want a book for mathematicians, this is an excellent first book on medical statistics.Essential Medical Statistics is a classic amongst medical statisticians. An introductory textbook, it presents statistics with a clarity and logic that demystifies the subject, while providing a comprehensive coverage of advanced as well as basic methods. The second edition of Essential Medical Statistics has been comprehensively revised and updated to include modern statistical methods and modern approaches to statistical analysis, while retaining the approachable and non-mathematical style of the first edition. The book now includes full coverage of the most commonly used regression models, multiple linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression and Cox regression, as well as a chapter on general issues in regression modelling. In addition, new chapters introduce more advanced topics such as meta-analysis, likelihood, bootstrapping and robust standard errors, and analysis of clustered data.Aimed at students of medical statistics, medical researchers, public health practitioners and practising clinicians using statistics in their daily work, the book is designed as both a teaching and a reference text. The format of the book is clear with highlighted formulae and worked examples, so that all concepts are presented in a simple, practical and easy-to-understand way. The second edition enhances the emphasis on choice of appropriate methods with new chapters on strategies for analysis and measures of association and impact.Essential Medical Statistics is supported by a web site at This useful online resource provides statistical datasets to download, as well as sample chapters and future updates.},

@article{Kuntsche2009,
abstract = {AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the feasibility, advantages and limitations of the combined use of Internet and SMS technology to assess alcohol use, and to test whether an SMS sent in the evening (i.e. prior to a possible drinking event) changed the respondents' assessment, made on the following day, of the number of drinks consumed. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy young adults (mean age 22.7) were recruited through face-to-face contacts, e-mails and Internet advertisements. DESIGN AND SETTING: Participants completed a baseline assessment via Internet and were randomly assigned to two conditions (with and without evening SMS). Over four weekends, both Friday and Saturday night, drinking was assessed via SMS questions sent the next day to the participants' cell phones. RESULTS: A high retention rate (75\% in total) was obtained across all three recruitment conditions. The number of drinks indicated in the SMS survey was strongly correlated with the usual quantity assessed via Internet and did not differ depending on whether an additional SMS question was sent in the evening or not. CONCLUSION: The new method shares some of the advantages of conventional diaries but overcomes most of the limitations: it is easy to use, cost-effective and suitable for large-scale surveys. Application restrictions and further developments are discussed.},

@misc{Nice2010,
abstract = {This clinical guideline on depression is an updated edition of the previous guidance (published in 2004). It was commissioned by NICE and developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, and sets out clear, evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for healthcare staff on how to treat and manage depression in adults. Depression affects 6\% of adults each year and is the leading cause of suicide. Its symptoms can be disabling and its effects pervasive, impacting on not only the individual patient but also on their families and the wider society. The NICE guideline is an invaluable resource enabling healthcare professionals to recognise, assess and offer effective treatments for this common mental health problem, which can become a chronic disorder if inadequately treated. Many areas of the previous guideline have been updated in this edition. There is a new introduction about depression and current practice, and a new chapter on service user and carer experience of care. The evidence reviews of service models and psychological and psychosocial interventions have all been updated and there is a new emphasis on low-intensity psychosocial interventions and an increased range of effective psychological interventions. The chapters on pharmacological interventions provide more detailed advice on sequencing treatments after limited response to initial interventions. This new edition of the guideline also covers the management of subthreshold depressive symptoms, which was not part of the scope of the previous guideline.},

abstract = {Stathopoulou, Powers, Berry, Smits, and Otto (2006) conducted a meta-analysis of exercise as a treatment for depression. The empirical evidence is convincing that exercise either alone or in combination with other evidence-supported treatment is effective in treating clinically significant depression. The challenge lies in translating the convincing evidence into effective practice. This commentary focuses on the barriers that clinicians encounter in utilizing exercise in the face of depressive symptoms, pessimism, low motivation, and physical inactivity and withdrawal. We also discuss some practical suggestions to enhance the likelihood that patients with depression implement and maintain exercise behaviors to improve their mood. 2006 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {It is clear that insomnia and depression are intimately related, which may suggest an overlapping neurobiology. Although much progress has been made toward understanding how these disorders relate to each other, the exact neurobiological mechanisms that link them remain elusive. Sleep changes in depression may be associated with abnormal neurotransmission, genetic polymorphisms, HPA overactivity, impaired plasticity, or most likely a combination of factors. It is therefore crucial that sleep assessments go beyond traditional polysomnography to include a more expanded set of objective measures in the hope that these will uncover the common neurobiology that is thought to underlie insomnia and depression.},
