abstract = {BACKGROUND: A consistent finding of representative surveys that were conducted in Germany in the early 1990s was that people with depression encountered a substantial amount of stigma and discrimination. The aim of this study was to examine whether public attitudes have improved over the last decade or not. METHODS: In 2001, a representative survey was carried out among the adult population of the "old" Federal Republic of Germany using the same methodology as in a previous survey in 1990. RESULTS: Regarding emotional reactions of the respondents towards people with depression, our findings are inconsistent. While there has been an increase in the readiness to feel pity and also a slight increase in the tendency to react aggressively, the expression of fear remained unchanged. The public's desire for social distance from people with depression was as strong in 2001 as it had been in 1990. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis of a change for the better regarding public attitudes towards depressed people is not supported by our findings. Further efforts are needed to reach this goal.},

abstract = {TB control in the Western Pacific Region has seen substantial progress in the last decade with a 33\% reduction in prevalent TB cases since 2000. The burden remains immense however, and national TB programmes must evolve and adapt in order to build upon these gains. Through routine surveillance, countries and areas in the Region reported 1.4 million TB cases in 2012. The case notification rate increased in the early 2000s and in recent years appears to have stabilized and is in decline for all forms and new smear-positive cases respectively. The age and sex breakdown for smear-positive TB case rates by country shows generally higher rates with increased age and declining rates over time for all age groups. Treatment success remains high in the region with 15 countries across the region reaching or maintaining 85\%. HIV testing among TB patients has increased gradually along with a slow decline in the number of HIV-positive patients found.  The trend of TB notification is heavily influenced by programmatic improvements in many countries and rapidly changing demographics. It appears that cases are being found earlier as reflected in declining rates of smear-positive TB with steady rates of TB in all forms. WHO estimates depict a decline in TB incidence in the Region. HIV testing, while still low, has increased substantially in recent years with essential TB/HIV services expanding in many countries.  TB surveillance data, within inherent limitations, is an important source of programmatic and epidemiological information. Careful interpretation of these findings can provide useful insight for programmatic decision making.Â },

@misc{Nice2010,
abstract = {This clinical guideline on depression is an updated edition of the previous guidance (published in 2004). It was commissioned by NICE and developed by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, and sets out clear, evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for healthcare staff on how to treat and manage depression in adults. Depression affects 6\% of adults each year and is the leading cause of suicide. Its symptoms can be disabling and its effects pervasive, impacting on not only the individual patient but also on their families and the wider society. The NICE guideline is an invaluable resource enabling healthcare professionals to recognise, assess and offer effective treatments for this common mental health problem, which can become a chronic disorder if inadequately treated. Many areas of the previous guideline have been updated in this edition. There is a new introduction about depression and current practice, and a new chapter on service user and carer experience of care. The evidence reviews of service models and psychological and psychosocial interventions have all been updated and there is a new emphasis on low-intensity psychosocial interventions and an increased range of effective psychological interventions. The chapters on pharmacological interventions provide more detailed advice on sequencing treatments after limited response to initial interventions. This new edition of the guideline also covers the management of subthreshold depressive symptoms, which was not part of the scope of the previous guideline.},

@techreport{WorldHealthOrganization2014,
abstract = {This is the nineteenth global report on tuberculosis (TB) published by WHO in a series that started in 1997. It provides a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the TB epidemic and progress in implementing and financing TB prevention, care and control at global, regional and country levels using data reported by over 200 countries that account for over 99\% of the world's TB cases. The report is accompanied by a special supplement that marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Global Project on Anti-TB Drug Resistance Surveillance. The supplement highlights the latest status of knowledge about the epidemic of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and the programmatic response. The report has 9 main chapters. The introductory chapter provides general background on TB as well as an explanation of current global targets for TB control, the WHO's Stop TB Strategy that covers the period 2006-2015 and the post-2015 global TB strategy that was recently endorsed by all Member States at the 2014 World Health Assembly. The remaining eight chapters cover the disease burden caused by TB (incidence, prevalence, mortality); a special assessment ("countdown to 2015) of progress towards 2015 global TB targets at global, regional and country level; TB case notifications and treatment outcomes; drug resistance surveillance among TB patients and the programmatic response in detecting and providing treatment for multidrug-resistant TB; diagnostics and laboratory strengthening for TB; addressing the co-epidemics of TB and HIV; financing TB care and control; and research and development for new TB diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. The three annexes of the report include an explanation of how to access and use the online global TB database, one-page profiles for 22 high TB-burden countries and one page regional profiles for WHO's six regions.},

@techreport{WorldHealthOrganization2011,
abstract = {Significant progress has been made in TB control in the Western Pacific Region in the past decade with a decline in the number of prevalent TB patients and the diagnosis treatment of over 10 million patients. Despite these successes, TB control programmes in the Region face significant challenges, such as hard-to-reach vulnerable and marginalized groups, in which the TB epidemic tends to concentrate, TB-HIV co-infection and the emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB, especially multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). To mitigate these threats, the Regional Strategy to Stop Tuberculosis in the Western Pacific (2011-2015) was developed in consultation with and endorsed by Member States. The new Strategy builds upon the previous two regional strategic plans and introduces new, evidence-based interventions and technologies in response to the new and emerging challenges. The Strategy provides a reference for action to be taken, focusing on five core objectives: (1) Promoting universal and equitable access to quality TB diagnosis and treatment for all people; (2) Strengthening TB laboratory capacity; (3) Scaling up the programmatic management of drug-resistant TB; (4) Expanding TB/HIV collaborative activities; and (5) Strengthening TB programme management capacity.},
