abstract = {Two decades ago, WHO declared tuberculosis a global emergency, and invested in the highly cost-effective directly observed treatment short-course programme to control the epidemic. At that time, most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were susceptible to first-line tuberculosis drugs, and drug resistance was not a major issue. However, in 2013, tuberculosis remains a major public health concern worldwide, with prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis rising. WHO estimates roughly 630 000 cases of MDR tuberculosis worldwide, with great variation in the frequency of MDR tuberculosis between countries. In the past 8 years, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis has emerged, and has been reported in 84 countries, heralding the possibility of virtually untreatable tuberculosis. Increased population movement, the continuing HIV pandemic, and the rise in MDR tuberculosis pose formidable challenges to the global control of tuberculosis. We provide an overview of the global burden of drug-resistant disease; discuss the social, health service, management, and control issues that fuel and sustain the epidemic; and suggest specific recommendations for important next steps. Visionary political leadership is needed to curb the rise of MDR and XDR tuberculosis worldwide, through sustained funding and the implementation of global and regional action plans. © 2013 World Health Organization.

abstract = {TB control in the Western Pacific Region has seen substantial progress in the last decade with a 33\% reduction in prevalent TB cases since 2000. The burden remains immense however, and national TB programmes must evolve and adapt in order to build upon these gains. Through routine surveillance, countries and areas in the Region reported 1.4 million TB cases in 2012. The case notification rate increased in the early 2000s and in recent years appears to have stabilized and is in decline for all forms and new smear-positive cases respectively. The age and sex breakdown for smear-positive TB case rates by country shows generally higher rates with increased age and declining rates over time for all age groups. Treatment success remains high in the region with 15 countries across the region reaching or maintaining 85\%. HIV testing among TB patients has increased gradually along with a slow decline in the number of HIV-positive patients found. The trend of TB notification is heavily influenced by programmatic improvements in many countries and rapidly changing demographics. It appears that cases are being found earlier as reflected in declining rates of smear-positive TB with steady rates of TB in all forms. WHO estimates depict a decline in TB incidence in the Region. HIV testing, while still low, has increased substantially in recent years with essential TB/HIV services expanding in many countries. TB surveillance data, within inherent limitations, is an important source of programmatic and epidemiological information. Careful interpretation of these findings can provide useful insight for programmatic decision making.},

Data on adverse events were collected from five DOTS-Plus sites in Estonia, Latvia, Peru (Lima), the Philippines (Manila) and the Russian Federation (Tomsk Oblast). The results show that among 818 patients enrolled on MDR-TB treatment only 2\% of patients stopped treatment, but 30\% required removal of the suspected drug(s) from the regimen due to adverse events. The study shows that adverse events are manageable in the treatment of MDR-TB in resource-limited settings provided that standard management strategies are applied.},

abstract = {The replication of important findings by multiple independent investigators is fundamental to the accumulation of scientific evidence. Researchers in the biologic and physical sciences expect results to be replicated by independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments. Epidemiologic studies are commonly used to quantify small health effects of important, but subtle, risk factors, and replication is of critical importance where results can inform substantial policy decisions. However, because of the time, expense, and opportunism of many current epidemiologic studies, it is often impossible to fully replicate their findings. An attainable minimum standard is "reproducibility," which calls for data sets and software to be made available for verifying published findings and conducting alternative analyses. The authors outline a standard for reproducibility and evaluate the reproducibility of current epidemiologic research. They also propose methods for reproducible research and implement them by use of a case study in air pollution and health.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Even when tuberculosis (TB) treatment is free, hidden costs incurred by patients and their households (TB-affected households) may worsen poverty and health. Extreme TB-associated costs have been termed "catastrophic" but are poorly defined. We studied TB-affected households' hidden costs and their association with adverse TB outcome to create a clinically relevant definition of catastrophic costs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: From 26 October 2002 to 30 November 2009, TB patients (n = 876, 11\% with multi-drug-resistant [MDR] TB) and healthy controls (n = 487) were recruited to a prospective cohort study in shantytowns in Lima, Peru. Patients were interviewed prior to and every 2-4 wk throughout treatment, recording direct (household expenses) and indirect (lost income) TB-related costs. Costs were expressed as a proportion of the household's annual income. In poorer households, costs were lower but constituted a higher proportion of the household's annual income: 27\% (95\% CI = 20\%-43\%) in the least-poor houses versus 48\% (95\% CI = 36\%-50\%) in the poorest. Adverse TB outcome was defined as death, treatment abandonment or treatment failure during therapy, or recurrence within 2 y. 23\% (166/725) of patients with a defined treatment outcome had an adverse outcome. Total costs ≥20\% of household annual income was defined as catastrophic because this threshold was most strongly associated with adverse TB outcome. Catastrophic costs were incurred by 345 households (39\%). Having MDR TB was associated with a higher likelihood of incurring catastrophic costs (54\% [95\% CI = 43\%-61\%] versus 38\% [95\% CI = 34\%-41\%], p<0.003). Adverse outcome was independently associated with MDR TB (odds ratio [OR] = 8.4 [95\% CI = 4.7-15], p<0.001), previous TB (OR = 2.1 [95\% CI = 1.3-3.5], p = 0.005), days too unwell to work pre-treatment (OR = 1.01 [95\% CI = 1.00-1.01], p = 0.02), and catastrophic costs (OR = 1.7 [95\% CI = 1.1-2.6], p = 0.01). The adjusted population attributable fraction of adverse outcomes explained by catastrophic costs was 18\% (95\% CI = 6.9\%-28\%), similar to that of MDR TB (20\% [95\% CI = 14\%-25\%]). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that existing catastrophic costs thresholds (≥10\% or ≥15\% of household annual income) were not associated with adverse outcome in our setting. Study limitations included not measuring certain "dis-saving" variables (including selling household items) and gathering only 6 mo of costs-specific follow-up data for MDR TB patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Despite free TB care, having TB disease was expensive for impoverished TB patients in Peru. Incurring higher relative costs was associated with adverse TB outcome. The population attributable fraction indicated that catastrophic costs and MDR TB were associated with similar proportions of adverse outcomes. Thus TB is a socioeconomic as well as infectious problem, and TB control interventions should address both the economic and clinical aspects of this disease.

abstract = {This is the nineteenth global report on tuberculosis (TB) published by WHO in a series that started in 1997. It provides a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the TB epidemic and progress in implementing and financing TB prevention, care and control at global, regional and country levels using data reported by over 200 countries that account for over 99\% of the world's TB cases. The report is accompanied by a special supplement that marks the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Global Project on Anti-TB Drug Resistance Surveillance. The supplement highlights the latest status of knowledge about the epidemic of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and the programmatic response. The report has 9 main chapters. The introductory chapter provides general background on TB as well as an explanation of current global targets for TB control, the WHO's Stop TB Strategy that covers the period 2006-2015 and the post-2015 global TB strategy that was recently endorsed by all Member States at the 2014 World Health Assembly. The remaining eight chapters cover the disease burden caused by TB (incidence, prevalence, mortality); a special assessment ("countdown to 2015) of progress towards 2015 global TB targets at global, regional and country level; TB case notifications and treatment outcomes; drug resistance surveillance among TB patients and the programmatic response in detecting and providing treatment for multidrug-resistant TB; diagnostics and laboratory strengthening for TB; addressing the co-epidemics of TB and HIV; financing TB care and control; and research and development for new TB diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. The three annexes of the report include an explanation of how to access and use the online global TB database, one-page profiles for 22 high TB-burden countries and one page regional profiles for WHO's six regions.},

abstract = {Significant progress has been made in TB control in the Western Pacific Region in the past decade with a decline in the number of prevalent TB patients and the diagnosis treatment of over 10 million patients. Despite these successes, TB control programmes in the Region face significant challenges, such as hard-to-reach vulnerable and marginalized groups, in which the TB epidemic tends to concentrate, TB-HIV co-infection and the emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB, especially multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). To mitigate these threats, the Regional Strategy to Stop Tuberculosis in the Western Pacific (2011-2015) was developed in consultation with and endorsed by Member States. The new Strategy builds upon the previous two regional strategic plans and introduces new, evidence-based interventions and technologies in response to the new and emerging challenges. The Strategy provides a reference for action to be taken, focusing on five core objectives: (1) Promoting universal and equitable access to quality TB diagnosis and treatment for all people; (2) Strengthening TB laboratory capacity; (3) Scaling up the programmatic management of drug-resistant TB; (4) Expanding TB/HIV collaborative activities; and (5) Strengthening TB programme management capacity.},
